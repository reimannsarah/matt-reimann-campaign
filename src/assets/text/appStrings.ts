    p2: "Through the will of the voters we have moved to a new structure separating direct bureau oversight (the old model) to a true commission or legislative style of government.  The new Portland CiIty Commission will be the legislative body (similar to Congress) that sets city policy, the city budget, advocates for district residents, and more.",
    p3: "If elected, I will prioritize setting the cornerstone for a well functioning city government with a high level of service to its citizens and an appropriate cost structure.  In addition, I will be a key advocate for issues impacting District 4 as well as greater Portland.",

        "Houseless Community. - this is not a problem unique to Portland.  This is an issue that is nationwide.  Through surveys,interviews, and studies (such as the PSU PiT reports), we know that this community is largely made up of people suffering from mental health, drug addiction, partner/family violence being plain down on their luck, and some combination of all three.  We can fix this compassionately with an aim to break the cycle.  So it should be addressed from all angles - local, state and federal",
      point1:
        "I would advocate for a more coordinated and focused effort to help the houseless be housed, and get on a path to exiting the streets. I believe this is a crisis and this will take a huge focused effort across local, regional, and state agencies to solve",

        "We are not short of money to address this, I don’t believe we need more.   Between Measure 10, Metro Supporting Housing Services tax, and Governor Kotek’s efforts we have the funding and the tools to tackle this problem",

    p1: "I am a native Oregonian and grew up in rural Washington County (it’s not rural anymore) in the Western foothills of Forest Park.  In my youth, neighborhood friends and I would hike to Forest Park and camp where there are now houses.  In my high school summers I worked in downtown Portland, mostly in what is now the Pearl District.",
    p2: "My mother was an elementary school teacher and later a High School counselor at Sunset High School, just minutes from our home.  My father was one of the first 100 employees at Tektronix, an early high-tech upstart.  With four kids to raise, they had their hands full.",
    p3: "I ventured south to Willamette University for college where I continued my love of soccer and became involved in school politics.  I was Vice President of my fraternity and a Senator representing my Fraternity in the Student Body.  My senior year at Willamette I studied abroad in Munich and finished my studies in Economics.  I stayed for a while, took more classes and worked at the German Post Office!  I fell in love with Europe and the myriad cultures, food, and people.",
    p4: "Returning to Oregon, I worked in the Silicon Forest and for the City of Portland, before going to business school in New York City at Columbia University.  Among many opportunities, I chose a west coast corporation as my next chapter and to pursue my interest in international business.  Hewlett Packard was at the beginning of a massive growth cycle and changed the whole personal printing market.  I became an executive in the mid 2000’s and worked in the Laserjet business.",
    p5: "From HP I started a small business with a partner in food services.  I also co-founded a non-profit (LEAP Adventures)  that specializes in Wilderness Therapy addressing groups of people who have suffered from trauma.",
    p6: "The Portland population has grown over 10% from 2010 to 2020, faster than LA, San Diego and San Francisco (King County grew 17+%).  That’s because this is a great city.  Since then, we have shrunk in population.  I believe we can become a thriving business and culture community again.",
    p7: "I hope to be a part of a very pivotal moment for the city of Portland and its new government structure.  It is this inaugural class of City Councillors that will set the precedent, especially as it relates to the relationship between the City Council and the City Government run by the Mayor.  This is a very exciting time."
